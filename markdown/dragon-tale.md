# Dragon's Tale

Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a brave knight named Sir Lancelot. He was known for his courage and strength. One day, a fearsome dragon began terrorizing the kingdom. Sir Lancelot set out on a quest to slay the dragon. After a long and perilous journey, he found the dragon's lair. With a mighty roar, he charged at the beast. The battle was fierce, but Sir Lancelot's skill and brabery prevailed. He slayed the dragon and returned to the kingdom as a hero, bringing peace and joy to the land once more.
